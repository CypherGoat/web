**Chart Pattern**  
No clear pattern detected.  
Support around **321.47**; next resistance near **796.09**.

**Outlook**  
Momentum: bearish. Short-term trend: uptrend. As long as XMR stays above **321.47**, setup favors bulls. A close below **315.04** would weaken the setup.

#### Contact Me

Found anything worth noting? Want to send something to be included in the next issue? Want to chat about something?

You can contact me on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@recanman:kernal.eu). Be aware that Matrix is centralized due to the fact that most people make an account on [Matrix.org](https://matrix.org/) operated by the Matrix Foundation - That's [a lot of metadata](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=PxwEwwlDM8Q&t=28) controlled unjust by just one entity.
