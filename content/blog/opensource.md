We are extremely happy to announce that the CypherGoat web-ui is now open source! This means that anyone can audit and modify our source code. People can verify that we are doing what we promise and contribute to make it even better.

### Why this matters
We are the only aggregator on the market that is open source. That's a pretty big deal. With CypherGoat, you don’t have to trust; you can verify. Head over to our [GitHub](https://github.com/CypherGoat/web) and see for yourself!

### Join Us!
