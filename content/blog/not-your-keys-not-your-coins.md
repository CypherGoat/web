When Satoshi Nakamoto first created Bitcoin the idea was creating a decentralized financial system where people control their own money. But today millions of users leave their crypto on Centralized Exchanges. This is not much different than using a bank. **What is the point of crypto if you don't own your funds**?

Storing crypto on a Centralized Exchange (CEX) is a **huge** risk. The phrase **"Not your keys, not your coins"** is a warning: if you don’t control your private keys you don’t truly own your crypto. History has shown that centralized exchanges can fail, get hacked, or freeze funds leaving users with nothing.

## Why centralized exchanges are risky

### 1. You don't control your funds
Obviously when you deposit crypto in an exchange it is no longer yours, it is the exchanges. If the exchange disappears so do your funds. 

### 2. Hacks and security breaches
CEX's are often targeted by hackers. Some of the biggest hacks include:
1. **Mt. Gox** (2014): Around 850,000 BTC were stolen, leading to the exchange's bankruptcy.​
2. **Coincheck** (2018): Hackers stole around $530 million worth of NEM.
3. **Bybit** (2025): In a recent breach Bybit suffered losses exceeding $1.4 billion in various tokens.
And many more 
### 3. Exchange collapses and bankruptcy
Some exchanges collapse not because of hacks, but because they spent **your** money and can't cover the withdraws.

Some examples include:

1. **FTX** (2022): Customer funds were being funneled into the exchanges sister company Alameda research where they were used to cover risky bets.
An **$8 billion** hole was created in the balance sheet and the exchange collapsed. Withdraws were frozen and millions of users lost their money.

2. **QuadrigaCX** (2019):
The CEO, Gerald Cotten, controlled all the exchange’s funds and when he died, $190 million in customer deposits disappeared. Investigators later found that Cotten had been using customer funds for personal spending and fraudulent trading.

3. **Celsius** (2022):
Marketed as a "crypto bank" Celsius promised high yields with "minimal risk", but was actually using customer funds to pay previous users, a classic Ponzi scheme.

## How to protect yourself
Always store your crypto in non custodial wallets. Once a trade is complete withdraw all money from the CEX, only keep what you can afford to lose on CEX's. 

Some great and easy to use non custodial wallets include:
