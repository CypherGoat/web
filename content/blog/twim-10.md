**Chart Pattern**  
No clear pattern detected.  
Support around **256.02**; next resistance near **458.97**.

**Outlook**  
Momentum: bullish. Short-term trend: uptrend. As long as XMR stays above **256.02**, setup favors bulls. A close below **250.90** would weaken the setup.

You can contact me on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@recanman:kernal.eu).
