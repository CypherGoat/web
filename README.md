## Add support for a coin
To add support for a new coin, it must first be available on at least one of our partnered exchanges. You can view the list of supported exchanges [here](https://cyphergoat.com/#our-partners).

Once confirmed, follow these steps:

1. **Edit the `coins.json` File**  
   Add your coin to the [`coins.json`](https://github.com/CypherGoat/web/blob/main/static/coins.json) file. Use the following format as a template:


```json
   {
     "ticker": "xmr",
     "name": "Monero",
     "network": "xmr",
     "isStable": false,
     "icon": "icons/xmr.webp",
     "min": 0
   }
```

> Note: you should leave the min as 0 and it will be completed by our automated system.

2. **Add the Coin Icon**

Upload the coin’s logo (preferably from coingecko) to the [icons folder](https://github.com/CypherGoat/web/tree/main/static/icons)

## API intergration
CypherGoat requires an API key for fetching exchange rates and executing trades. The API provides endpoints for
- Fetching estimates
- Creating transactions
- Tracking transaction status

See our API documentation at [api.cyphergoat.com](https://api.cyphergoat.com)

You can request an api key sending us an email to [support@cyphergoat.com](mailto:support@cyphergoat.com) or by submitting [this form](https://tally.so/r/mKGkOX)
